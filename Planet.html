   <h1  class="Mercury" id="Mercury's">Mercury</h1>
            <div class="mercury">
       <p class="mer1">Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun. It's only slightly larger than<br>
                       Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large<br>
                       as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter.<br></p>

            <img class="merimg" src="Planet\Mercury.webp">  
     <p class="merdet">Mercury's surface temperatures are both extremely hot and cold. Because the planet is so close to the Sun,<br> 
                       day temperatures can reach highs of 800°F (430°C). Without an atmosphere to retain that heat at night,<br> 
                       temperatures can dip as low as -290°F (-180°C).<br><br>

                       Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs<br> 
                       to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around<br> 
                       the Sun every 88 Earth days.<br></p>
    <h1 class="mercname">Namesake</h1> 
    <p class="mercname1">Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.<br></p>    
    <h1 class="mercpl">Potential for Life</h1>
     <p class="mercpl1 ">Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation<br> 
                         that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for organisms to adapt to.<br></p>

    <h1 class="mercsd">Size and Distance</h1>
      <p class="mercsd1">With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.<br> 
                         If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.<br><br>

                         From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units<br> 
                         away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth.<br> 
                         From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.<br></p>

    <h1 class="mercor">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
      <p class="mercor1">Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles<br>
                         (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds<br> 
                         around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second,<br>
                         faster than any other planet.<br><br>

                         Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is<br>
                         moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation<br> 
                         is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to<br> 
                         rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in<br> 
                         everse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle)<br> 
                         equals 176 Earth days – just over two years on Mercury.<br><br>
                         
                         Mercury's axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the<br>
                         Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons<br> 
                         as many other planets do.<br></p>

    <h1 class="mercmn">Moons</h1>
    <p class="mercmn1">Mercury doesn't have moons.</p>
    <h1 class="mercring">Rings</h1>
    <p class="mercring1">Mercury doesn't have rings.</p>
    <h1 class="mercfm">Formation</h1>
      <p class="mercfm1">Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form<br> 
                         this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core,<br> 
                         a rocky mantle, and a solid crust.<br></p>

   <h1 class="mercst">Structure</h1>
       <p class="mercst1">Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about<br> 
                          1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85% of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it is partly<br> 
                          molten or liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the mantle and crust)<br> 
                          is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.<br></p>

   <h1 class="mercsf">Surface</h1>  
       <p class="mercsf1">Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions<br> 
                          with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists,<br> 
                          musicians, or authors, including children's author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.<br><br>

                          Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff<br> 
                          (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in<br> 
                          the solar system's history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some<br> 
                          hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet's interior cooled and<br> 
                          contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.<br><br>
                          
                          Most of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called<br>
                          "crater rays." They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of<br> 
                          energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of<br> 
                          rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to<br> 
                          the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the<br> 
                          rays look brighter. The space environment – dust impacts and solar-wind particles – causes the rays to darken<br> 
                          with time.<br><br>
                          
                          Temperatures on Mercury are extreme. During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit<br>
                          (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the<br> 
                          surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).<br><br>
                          
                          Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions in permanent<br>
                          shadows. In those shadows, it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on<br> 
                          sunlit parts of the planet.<br></p>                    

    <h1 class="mercat">Atmosphere</h1>
       <p class="mercat1">Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar<br> 
                          wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium,<br> 
                          hydrogen, helium, and potassium.<br></p>

   <h1 class="mercms">Magnetosphere</h1>
       <p class="mercms1">Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface<br>
                          has just 1% the strength of Earth's, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create<br> 
                          intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the<br> 
                          ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.<br></p>

<h1 class="venu" id="Venus">Venus</h1>
<div class="venus">
         <p class="ven1">Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and our closest planetary neighbor. It's the hottest planet in our solar<br>
                         system, and is sometimes called Earth's twin.<br></p>

        <img class="venimg" src="Planet\Venus.jpg">
       <p class="vendet">Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and Earth's closest planetary neighbor. Venus is the third brightest object<br> 
                         in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.<br><br>

                         Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, and is sometimes called Earth's evil twin. Its thick atmosphere<br> 
                         traps heat in a runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our solar system with<br> 
                         surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. Below the dense, persistent clouds, the surface<br> 
                         has volcanoes and deformed mountains.<br></p>

      <h1 class="venname">Namesake</h1>
     <p class="venname1">The ancient Romans could easily see seven bright objects in the sky: the Sun, the Moon, and the five brightest planets:<br> 
                         Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. They named the objects after their most important gods.<br><br>

                         Venus is named for the ancient Roman goddess of love and beauty, who was known as Aphrodite to the ancient Greeks. Most<br> 
                         features on Venus are named for women. It’s the only planet named after a female god.<br></p>

     <h1 class="venpl">Potential for Life</h1>
       <p class="venpl1">Thirty miles up (about 50 kilometers) from the surface of Venus temperatures range from 86 to 158 Fahrenheit (30 to 70<br> 
                         Celsius). This temperature range could accommodate Earthly life, such as “extremophile” microbes. And atmospheric<br> 
                         pressure at that height is similar to what we find on Earth’s surface.<br><br>

                         At the tops of Venus’ clouds, whipped around the planet by winds measured as high as 224 mph (360 kph), we find another<br> 
                         transformation. Persistent, dark streaks appear. Scientists are so far unable to explain why these streaks remain<br> 
                         stubbornly intact, even amid hurricane-force winds. They also have the odd habit of absorbing ultraviolet radiation.<br><br>
                         
                         The most likely explanations focus on fine particles, ice crystals, or even a chemical compound called iron chloride.<br> 
                         Although it's much less likely, another possibility considered by scientists who study astrobiology is that these<br> 
                         streaks could be made up of microbial life, Venus-style. Astrobiologists note that ring-shaped linkages of sulfur atoms,<br> 
                         known to exist in Venus’ atmosphere, could provide microbes with a kind of coating that would protect them from<br> 
                         sulfuric acid. These handy chemical cloaks would also absorb potentially damaging ultraviolet light and re-radiate<br> 
                         it as visible light.<br><br>
                         
                         Some of the Russian Venera probes did, indeed, detect particles in Venus’ lower atmosphere about a micron in<br>
                         length – roughly the same size as a bacterium on Earth.<br><br>
                         
                         None of these findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of life in Venus’ clouds. But the questions they<br> 
                         raise, along with Venus’ vanished ocean, its violently volcanic surface, and its hellish history, make a compelling<br> 
                         case for missions to investigate our temperamental sister planet. There is much, it would seem, that she can teach us.<br></p>

      <h1 class="vensd">Size and Distance</h1>
       <p class="vensd1">Venus orbits the Sun from an average distance of 67 million miles (108 million kilometers), or 0.72 astronomical units.<br>
                         One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight<br> 
                         about six minutes to travel from the Sun to Venus.<br><br>
                         
                         Earth's nearness to Venus is a matter of perspective. The planet is nearly as big around as Earth. Its diameter at its <br>
                         equator is about 7,521 miles (12,104 kilometers), versus 7,926 miles (12,756 kilometers) for Earth. From Earth, Venus<br> 
                         is the brightest object in the night sky after our own Moon. The ancients, therefore, gave it great importance in<br> 
                         their cultures, even thinking it was two objects: a morning star and an evening star. That’s where the <br>
                         trick of perspective comes in.<br><br>
                         
                         Because Venus’ orbit is closer to the Sun than ours, the two of them – from our viewpoint – never stray far from each<br> 
                         other. The ancient Egyptians and Greeks saw Venus in two guises: first in one orbital position (seen in the morning) <br>
                         then another (your “evening” Venus), just at different times of the year.<br><br>
                         
                         At its nearest to Earth, Venus is about 24 million (about 38 million kilometers) away. But most of the time the two <br>
                         planets are farther apart. The maximum distance between Venus and Earth is about 162 million miles (261 million <br>
                         kilometers). Mercury, the innermost planet, actually spends more time in Earth’s proximity than Venus.<br><br>
                         
                         One more trick of perspective: how Venus looks through binoculars or a telescope. Keep watch over many months, and <br>
                         you’ll notice that Venus has phases, just like our Moon – full, half, quarter, etc. The complete cycle, however,<br> 
                         new to full, takes 584 days, while our Moon takes just a month. And it was this perspective, the phases of Venus <br>
                         first observed by Galileo through hi<br></p>

    <h1 class="venor">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
       <p class="venor1">Spending a day on Venus would be quite a disorienting experience – that is, if your spacecraft or spacesuit could<br> 
                         protect you from temperatures in the range of 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 Celsius). For one thing, your “day”<br> 
                         would be 243 Earth days long – longer even than a Venus year (one trip around the Sun), which takes only 225 Earth<br> 
                         days. For another, because of the planet's extremely slow rotation, sunrise to sunset would take 117 Earth days.<br> 
                         And by the way, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east<br>
                         because Venus spins backward compared to Earth.<br><br>

                         While you’re waiting, don’t expect any seasonal relief from the unrelenting temperatures. On Earth, with its spin<br> 
                         axis tilted by about 23 degrees, we experience summer when our part of the planet (our hemisphere) receives the<br> 
                         Sun’s rays more directly – a result of that tilt. In winter, the tilt means the rays are less direct. No such<br> 
                         luck on Venus: Its very slight tilt is only three degrees, which is too little to produce noticeable seasons.<br></p>

  <h1 class="venmn">Moons</h1>
       <p class="venmn1">Venus is one of only two planets in our solar system that doesn't have a moon, but it does have a quasi-satellite<br> 
                         that has officially been named Zoozve. This object was discovered on Nov. 11, 2002, by Brian Skiff at the Lowell<br> 
                         Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) in Flagstaff, Arizona, a project funded by<br> 
                         NASA that ended in February 2008.  <br><br>

                         Quasi-satellites, sometimes called quasi-moons, are asteroids that orbit the Sun while staying close to a planet.<br> 
                         A quasi-satellite’s orbit usually is more oblong and less stable than the planet's orbit. In time, the shape of<br> 
                         a quasi-satellite’s orbit may change and it may move away from the planet.<br><br> 
                         
                         According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the organization that names space objects, Zoozve is the <br>
                         first-identified quasi-satellite of a major planet. Earth also has quasi-satellites<br> 
                         including a small asteroid discovered in 2016.<br> 
                         
                         Based on its brightness, scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) estimate Zoozve ranges in size<br> 
                         from 660 feet (200 meters) to 1,640 feet (500 meters) across.<br><br> 
                         
                         Interestingly, Zoozve also orbits relatively close to Earth but does not pose a threat to our planet. <br>
                         For the next 175 years, the closest Zoozve will get to Earth is in the year 2149 when it will be<br> 
                         about 2.2 million miles (3.5 million kilometers) away, or about 9 times<br> 
                         the distance from Earth to the Moon.<br></p>
    <h3 class="venmns">How Zoozve Got Its Name </h3>
       <p class="venmn1">After the discovery in 2002, Skiff reported his finding to the Minor Planet Center, which is funded by a Near-Earth<br> 
                         Object (NEO) Observations Program grant from NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office. At that time, it was<br> 
                         given the provisional name 2002 VE68. Skiff said he didn’t realize the asteroid’s importance and forgot about the<br> 
                         object until a radio show host reached out to him in 2023 about naming it Zoozve.<br><br> 

                         Soon after Skiff’s discovery, a team of astronomers, including Seppo Mikkola with the University of Turku in Finland<br> 
                         and Paul Wiegert with the University of Western Ontario in London, determined that the object was the first of its<br> 
                         kind to be discovered. They think that Zoozve may have been a companion to Venus for at least 7,000 years<br> 
                         and that Earth’s gravity helped push Zoozve into its present orbit.<br><br> 
                         
                         The name Zoozve comes from a child's poster of the solar system. The artist, Alex Foster, saw “2002 VE68” on a list of <br>
                         solar system objects, wrote down “2002 VE,” and then misread his own handwriting as “Zoozve.” <br><br> 
                         
                         Latif Nasser, co-host of the WNYC Studios show Radiolab, tracked down the source of the mistake with the help of Liz<br> 
                         Landau, a NASA senior communications specialist. Nasser suggested that Skiff request that the IAU officially name<br> 
                         the asteroid Zoozve. Skiff agreed, and the name Zoozve was approved in February 2024.<br> </p>

   <h1 class="venring">Rings</h1>
    <p class="venring1">Venus has no rings.</p>
    <h1 class="venfm">Formation</h1>
       <p class="venfm1">A critical question for scientists who search for life among the stars: How do habitable planets get their start? The<br> 
                         close similarities of early Venus and Earth, and their very different fates, provide a kind of test case for<br> 
                         scientists who study planet formation. Similar size, similar interior structure, both harboring oceans in their <br>
                         younger days. Yet one is now an inferno, while the other is the only known world to host abundant life. The factors <br>
                         that set these planets on almost opposite paths began, most likely, in the swirling disk of gas and dust from which<br> 
                         they were born. Somehow, 4.6 billion years ago that disk around our Sun accreted, cooled, and settled into the<br> 
                         planets we know today. Better knowledge of the formation history of Venus could help us better understand<br> 
                         Earth – and rocky planets around other stars.<br></p>

   <h1 class="venst">Structure</h1>
       <p class="venst1">If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. <br>
                         Each planet has an iron core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior crust. On both<br> 
                         planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of<br> 
                         heat and pressure deep beneath.<br><br>

                         On Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as <br>
                         “plate tectonics.” Something similar might have happened on Venus early in its history. Today a key element of this<br> 
                         process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of one continental “plate” beneath another, which can also trigger<br> 
                         volcanoes. Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.<br><br>
                         
                         NASA’s Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped the broiling surface using radar.<br> 
                         Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism – a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms), and <br>
                         chains of towering mountains.<br></p>

        <h1 class="vensf">Surface</h1>
       <p class="vensf1">The Soviet Union sent a series of probes to Venus between 1961 and 1984 as part of its Venera program (Venera is Russian<br> 
                         for Venus). Ten probes made it to the surface, and a few functioned briefly after landing. The longest survivor lasted<br> 
                         two hours; the shortest, 23 minutes. Photos snapped before the landers fried show a barren, dim, and rocky landscape<br> 
                         and a sky that is likely some shade of sulfur yellow.<br><br>

                         Volcanoes and tectonic forces appear to have erased most traces of the early surface of Venus. Newer computer models<br> 
                         indicate the resurfacing may have happened piecemeal over an extended period of time. The average age of surface<br> 
                         features could be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.<br>
                         
                         Venus has valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes. Its surface features – most named for both real<br> 
                         and mythical women – include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near the north pole, and<br> 
                         an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite Terra that stretches across the equator. One mountain<br> 
                         reaches 36,000 feet (11 kilometers), higher than Mt. Everest. Notably, except for Earth, Venus has by far the fewest<br> 
                         impact craters of any rocky planet.<br></br>
                         
                         Other notable features of the Venus landscape include:<br></p>

<p class="vensf2">🌖 A volcanic crater named Sacajawea for Lewis and Clark’s Native American guide.<br>
                  🌖 A deep canyon called Diana for the Roman goddess of the hunt.<br>
                  🌖 “Pancake” domes with flat tops and steep sides, as wide as 38 miles (62 kilometers), likely formed by the extrusion of<br> 
                  🌖 highly viscous lava.<br>
                  🌖 “Tick” domes, odd volcanoes with radiating spurs that, from above, make them look like their blood-feeding namesake.<br>
                  🌖 Tesserae, terrain with intricate patterns of ridges and grooves that suggest the scorching temperatures make rock<br> 
                  🌖 behave in some ways more like peanut butter beneath a thin and strong chocolate layer on Venus.<br></p>

    <h1 class="venat">Atmosphere</h1>
         <p class=venat1>Venus’ atmosphere is one of extremes. With the hottest surface in the solar system, apart from the Sun itself, Venus is<br> 
                         hotter even than the innermost planet, charbroiled Mercury. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide – the same gas <br>                         
                         driving the greenhouse effect on Venus and Earth – with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. And at the surface, the hot<br>
                         high-pressure carbon dioxide behaves in a corrosive fashion. But higher up in the atmosphere, temperatures<br> 
                         and pressure begin to ease.<br></p>

     <h1 class="venmg">Magnetosphere</h1>
       <p class="venmg1">Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized iron core, the planet does not have its own <br>
                         internally generated magnetic field. Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak<br>                         
                         magnetic field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field and the planet's outer atmosphere.<br> 
                         Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus' outermost atmosphere; these electrically excited<br> 
                         gases are called ions, and thus this region is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well). <br>
                         The solar wind – a million-mile-per-hour gale of electrically charged particles streaming continuously from the<br> 
                         Sun – carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. When the Sun's magnetic field interacts with the electrically<br> 
                         excited ionosphere of Venus, it creates or induces, a magnetic field there. This induced magnetic field envelops<br> 
                         the planet and is shaped like an extended teardrop, or the tail of a comet, as the solar wind blows past Venus<br> 
                         and outward into the solar system.<br></p>

     <p class="jupiter1">Jupiter is a world of extremes. It's the largest planet in our solar system – if it were a hollow shell, 1,000 Earths<br> 
                         could fit inside. It's also the oldest planet, forming from the dust and gases left over from the Sun's<br> 
                         formation 4.6 billion years ago. But it has the shortest day in the solar system, taking about 9.9 hours to spin<br>

                         The king of planets was named for Jupiter, king of the gods in Roman mythology. Most of its moons are also named for<br> 
                         mythological characters, figures associated with Jupiter or his Greek counterpart, Zeus.<br></p>

     <h1 class="jupname">Namesake</h1>
     <p class="jupname1">Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.<br></p>
    <h1 class="juppl">Potential for Life</h1>
       <p class="juppl1">Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that<br> 
                         characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><br>

                         While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons.<br> 
                         Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean<br> 
                         just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.<br></p>

    <h1 class="jupsd">Size and Distance</h1>
       <p class="jupsd1">With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a grape<br> 
                         Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball.<br><br>

                         From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun.<br> 
                         One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes<br> 
                         sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.<br></p>

   <h1 class="jupor">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
       <p class="jupor1">Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes 9.9 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or <br>
                         spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about <br>
                         12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days).<br><br>

                         Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright<br> 
                         and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.<br></p>

    <h1 class="jupmn">Moons</h1>
       <p class="jupmn1">Galileo Galilei spotted the first Jupiter moons in 1610 with a new invention called a telescope.<br><br>
                         With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system.<br><br>

                         Jupiter has 95 moons that are officially recognized by the International Astronomical Union. The four largest moons – Io, Europa<br> 
                         Ganymede, and Callisto – were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope.<br> 
                         These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most<br> 
                         fascinating destinations in our solar system.<br></p>

    <h1 class="jupring">Rings</h1>
     <p class="jupring1">Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings were a surprise. The rings are composed of small, dark particles<br> 
                         and they are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter's ring system<br> 
                         may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons.<br></p>

     <h1 class="jupfm">Formation</h1>
       <p class="jupfm1">Jupiter took shape along with rest of the solar system about 4.6 billion years ago. Gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together <br>
                         to form this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice<br> 
                         the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did<br> 
                         not grow massive enough to ignite.<br><br>

                         About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is<br>
                         the fifth planet from the Sun.<br></p>

     <h1 class="jupst">Structure</h1>
       <p class="jupst1">The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun – mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and <br>
                         temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system – an <br>
                         ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center, the pressure<br> 
                         becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal.<br> 
                         Jupiter's fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, with the spinning of the liquid metallic hydrogen<br> 
                         acting like a dynamo, generating the planet's powerful magnetic field.<br><br>

                         Deeper down, Jupiter's central core had long been a mystery. Scientists theorized Jupiter was a mostly homogeneous mix of hydrogen<br> 
                         and helium gases, surrounding a small, solid core of heavier elements – ice, rock, and metal formed from debris and small objects<br> 
                         swirling around that area of the embryonic solar system 4 billion years ago.<br></p>
 
    <h1 class="jupsf">Surface</h1>
       <p class="jupsf1">As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft<br> 
                         would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and<br> 
                         temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt, and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.<br></p>

    <h1 class="jupat">Atmosphere</h1>
       <p class="jupat1">Jupiter's appearance is a tapestry of colorful stripes and spots – the cloud bands that encircle the planet, and the <br>
                         cyclonic storms dotting it from pole to pole. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in <br>
                         its "skies" that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top cloud is probably made of <br>
                         ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer <br>
                         may be made of water ice and vapor.<br><br>

                         The vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising <br>
                         from the planet's warmer interior. Jupiter's fast rotation – spinning once every 10 hours – creates strong jet streams<br> 
                         separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.<br><br>
                         
                         With no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter's spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a<br> 
                         dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the equator. The Great Red<br> 
                         Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. <br>
                         More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin.<br><br>
                         
                         Findings from NASA’s Juno probe released in October 2021 provide a fuller picture of what’s going on below those clouds.<br> 
                         Data from Juno shows that Jupiter’s cyclones are warmer on top, with lower atmospheric densities, while they are colder<br> 
                         at the bottom, with higher densities. Anticyclones, which rotate in the opposite direction, are colder at the top but<br> 
                         warmer at the bottom.<br><br>
                         
                         The findings also indicate these storms are far taller than expected, with some extending 60 miles (100 kilometers) below <br>
                         the cloud tops and others, including the Great Red Spot, extending over 200 miles (350 kilometers). This surprising <br>
                         discovery demonstrates that the vortices cover regions beyond those where water condenses and clouds form, below the<br> 
                         depth where sunlight warms the atmosphere.<br><br>
                         
                         The height and size of the Great Red Spot mean the concentration of atmospheric mass within the storm potentially could be <br>
                         detectable by instruments studying Jupiter’s gravity field. Two close Juno flybys over Jupiter’s most famous spot provided<br> 
                         the opportunity to search for the storm’s gravity signature and complement the other results on its depth.<br><br>
                         
                         With their gravity data, the Juno team was able to constrain the extent of the Great Red Spot to a depth of about 300 miles<br> 
                         (500 kilometers) below the cloud tops.<br><br>
                         
                         Belts and Zones In addition to cyclones and anticyclones, Jupiter is known for its distinctive belts and zones – white and <br>
                         reddish bands of clouds that wrap around the planet. Strong east-west winds moving in opposite directions separate the<br> 
                         bands. Juno previously discovered that these winds, or jet streams, reach depths of about 2,000 miles<br> 
                         (roughly 3,200 kilometers). Researchers are still trying to solve the mystery of how the jet streams form. Data collected<br> 
                         by Juno during multiple passes reveal one possible clue: that the atmosphere’s ammonia gas travels up and down in <br>
                         remarkable alignment with the observed jet streams.<br><br>
                         
                         Juno’s data also shows that the belts and zones undergo a transition around 40 miles (65 kilometers) beneath Jupiter’s water<br> 
                         clouds. At shallow depths, Jupiter’s belts are brighter in microwave light than the neighboring zones. But at deeper levels<br>
                         below the water clouds, the opposite is true – which reveals a similarity to our oceans.<br><br>
                         
                         Polar Cyclones Juno previously discovered polygonal arrangements of giant cyclonic storms at both of Jupiter’s poles – eight <br>
                         arranged in an octagonal pattern in the north and five arranged in a pentagonal pattern in the south. Over time, mission<br> 
                         scientists determined these atmospheric phenomena are extremely resilient, remaining in the same location.<br><br>
                         
                         Juno data also indicates that, like hurricanes on Earth, these cyclones want to move poleward, but cyclones located at the<br> 
                         center of each pole push them back. This balance explains where the cyclones reside and the different numbers at each pole.<br></p>

      <h1 class="jupmg">Magnetosphere</h1>
       <p class="jupmg1">The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter's powerful magnetic field. It balloons<br> 
                         600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of<br> 
                         Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion <br>
                         kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn's orbit. Jupiter's enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times <br>
                         as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric <br>
                         charge. Near the planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of charged particles and accelerates them to<br> 
                         very high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost moons and can damage spacecraft.<br><br>

                         Jupiter's magnetic field also causes some of the solar system's most spectacular aurorae at<br> 
                         the planet's poles.<br></p>

            <img class="Saturnimg" src="Planet\Saturn.jpg">
    <p class="saturndet">Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not<br> 
                         the only planet to have rings, but none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also<br> 
                         has dozens of moons.<br><br>

                         From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the<br> 
                         Saturn system is a rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.<br></p>

    <h1 class="satname">Namesake</h1>
     <p class="satname1">The farthest planet from Earth discovered by the unaided human eye, Saturn has been known since ancient<br> 
                         times. The planet is named for the Roman god of agriculture and wealth, who was also the father of Jupiter.<br></p>

   <h1 class="satpl">Potential for Life</h1>
       <p class="satpl1">Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that<br> 
                         characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br><br>

                         While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its<br> 
                         many moons. Satellites like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly support life.<br></p>

  <h1 class="satsd">Size and Distance</h1>
       <p class="satsd1">With an equatorial diameter of about 74,897 miles (120,500 kilometers), Saturn is 9 times wider than Earth.<br> 
                         If Earth were the size of a nickel, Saturn would be about as big as a volleyball.<br><br>

                         From an average distance of 886 million miles (1.4 billion kilometers), Saturn is 9.5 astronomical units away<br> 
                         from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this <br>
                         distance, it takes sunlight 80 minutes to travel from the Sun to Saturn.<br></p>

  <h1 class="sator">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
       <p class="sator1">Saturn has the second-shortest day in the solar system. One day on Saturn takes only 10.7 hours (the time it<br> 
                         takes for Saturn to rotate or spin around once), and Saturn makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in<br> 
                         Saturnian time) in about 29.4 Earth years (10,756 Earth days).<br><br>

                         Its axis is tilted by 26.73 degrees with respect to its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to<br> 
                         Earth's 23.5-degree tilt. This means that, like Earth, Saturn experiences seasons.<br></p>

   <h1 class="satmn">Moons</h1>
       <p class="satmn1">Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds. From the haze-shrouded surface of Titan<br> 
                         to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of Saturn's moons tells another piece of the story surrounding the <br>
                         Saturn system. As of June 8, 2023, Saturn has 146 moons in its orbit, with others continually awaiting<br> 
                         confirmation of their discovery and official naming by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).<br></p>

   <img class="satmnimg" src="Planet\SaturnMoon.jpg">

      <h1 class="satring">Rings</h1>
     <p class="satring1">Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before they <br>
                         reached the planet, torn apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small chunks of <br>
                         ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from tiny <br>
                         dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains. The rings <br>
                         would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring <br>
                         orbits at a different speed around the planet.<br><br>

                         Saturn's ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical<br> 
                         height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically in the order they <br>
                         were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap<br> 
                         measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. <br>
                         The main rings are A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently discovered.<br><br>
                         
                         Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A ring<br> 
                         F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the very faint Phoebe ring in the <br>
                         orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe.<br></p>

 <h1 class="satfm">Formation</h1>
       <p class="satfm1">Saturn took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled<br> 
                        swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. About 4 billion years ago, Saturn settled into its<br> 
                        current position in the outer solar system, where it is the sixth planet from the Sun. Like Jupiter<br> 
                        Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.<br></p>

    <h1 class="satst">Structure</h1>
      <p class="satst1">Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At Saturn's center is a dense core of metals<br> 
                        like iron and nickel surrounded by rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and <br>
                        heat. It is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen –similar to Jupiter's <br>
                        core but considerably smaller.<br><br>

                        It's hard to imagine, but Saturn is the only planet in our solar system with an average density that is<br> 
                        less than water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing existed.<br></p>

   <h1 calss="satsf">Surface</h1>
      <p class="satsf1">As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down.<br> 
                        While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either.<br> 
                        The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft<br> 
                        trying to fly into the planet.<br></p>

    <h1 class="satat">Atmosphere</h1>
      <p class="satat1">Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams, and storms. The planet is many<br> 
                        different shades of yellow, brown, and gray.<br><br>

                        Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region.<br> 
                        In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at about 360 feet per second (110 meters<br> 
                        per second). And the pressure – the same kind you feel when you dive deep underwater – is so powerful it<br> 
                        squeezes gas into a liquid.<br><br>
                        
                        Saturn's north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature – a six-sided jet stream. This hexagon-shaped <br>
                        pattern was first noticed in images from the Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the <br>
                        Cassini spacecraft since. Spanning about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, the hexagon is a wavy jet<br> 
                        stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds (about 322 kilometers per hour) with a massive, rotating storm at the<br> 
                        center. There is no weather feature like it anywhere else in the solar system.<br></p>

    <h1 class="satmg">Magnetosphere</h1>
      <p class="satmg1">Saturn's magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter's but still 578 times as powerful as Earth's. Saturn, the <br>
                        rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn's enormous magnetosphere, the region of space <br>
                        in which the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn's magnetic field than<br> 
                        by the solar wind.<br><br>

                        Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet's atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On Earth<br> 
                        these charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at least some of Saturn's aurorae are<br> 
                        like Jupiter's and are largely unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a<br> 
                        combination of particles ejected from Saturn's moons and Saturn's magnetic field's rapid rotation rate. But<br> 
                        these "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood yet.<br></p>

    <p class="urndet">Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons. Uranus<br> 
                      rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to<br> 
                      spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball.<br><br>

                      Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer <br>
                      William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the<br> 
                      object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.<br></p>

  <h1 class="urnname">Namesake</h1>
  <p class="urnname1">William Herschel tried unsuccessfully to name his discovery Georgium Sidus after King George III. Instead, the<br> 
                      planet was named for Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, as suggested by Johann Bode.<br></p>

  <h1 class="urnpl">Potential for Life</h1>
    <p class="urnpl1">Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that <br>
                      characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br></p>

  <h1 class="urnsd">Size and Distance</h1>
    <p class="urnsd1">With an equatorial diameter of 31,763 miles (51,118 kilometers), Uranus is four times wider than Earth. If Earth<br> 
                      was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.<br>

                      From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is about 19 astronomical units<br> 
                      away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From<br> 
                      this distance, it takes sunlight 2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.<br></p>

  <h1 class="urnor">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
    <p class="urnor1">One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours. This is the amount of time it takes Uranus to rotate, or spin once around <br>
                      its axis. Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian time) in <br>
                      about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days).<br><br>

                      Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees. This<br> 
                      may be the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This unique tilt causes Uranus to have the <br>
                      most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the Sun shines directly over <br>
                      each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a 21-year-long, dark winter.<br><br>
                      
                      Uranus is also one of just two planets that rotate in the opposite direction than most of the planets. Venus is<br> 
                      the other.<br></p>
  <h1 class="urnmn">Moons</h1>
    <p class="urnmn1">Uranus has 28 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or<br> 
                      Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare <br>
                      and Alexander Pope.<br>

                      All of Uranus' inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons<br> 
                      remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.<br></p>

  <h1 class="urnring">Rings</h1>
  <p class="urnring1">Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There are<br> 
                      two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer ring<br> 
                      is blue like Saturn's E ring.<br><br>

                      In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta<br> 
                      Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust.<br></p>

<h1 class="urnfm">Formation</h1>
    <p class="urnfm1">Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago – when gravity pulled swirling <br>
                      gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely formed closer to the Sun and moved <br>
                      to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.<br></p>

<h1 class="urnst">Structure</h1>
    <p class="urnst1">Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's<br> 
                      mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small rocky core.<br> 
                      Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).<br><br>

                      Uranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor Neptune, yet smaller in mass. It is the second least dense<br> 
                      planet; Saturn is the least dense of all.<br><br>
                      
                      Uranus gets its blue-green color from methane gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is<br> 
                      reflected back out by Uranus' cloud tops. Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light <br>
                      resulting in a blue-green color.<br></p>


 <h1 class="urnsf">Surface</h1>\
    <p class="urnsf1">As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would<br> 
                      have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. The extreme<br>
                      pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft.<br></p>

 <h1 class="urnat">Atmosphere</h1>
    <p class="urnat1">Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia.<br> 
                      The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.<br><br>

                      While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot, and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986 – more<br> 
                      recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including<br> 
                      rapidly changing bright features.<br><br>
                      
                      Uranus' planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even colder<br> 
                      than Neptune in some places.<br><br>
                      
                      Wind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are retrograde at <br>
                      the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the planet’s rotation. But closer to the poles, winds shift to a<br> 
                      prograde direction, flowing with Uranus' rotation.<br></p>
<h1 class="urnmg">Magnetosphere</h1>
    <p class="urnmg1">Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere. Magnetic fields are typically in alignment with a planet's<br> 
                      rotation, but Uranus' magnetic field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees from the planet's <br>
                      axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by one-third of the planet's radius.<br><br>

                      Uranus has auroras, but they are not in line with the poles like they are on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn. This is due <br>
                      to the planet's lopsided magnetic field.<br><br>
                      
                      The magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite the Sun extends into space for millions of miles. Its magnetic field<br> 
                      lines are twisted by Uranus’ sideways rotation into a long corkscrew shape.<br></p>

<h1 class="Neptune" id="Neptune">Neptune</h1>
<div class="Neptunes">

     <p class="neptune">Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.<br></p>
     <img class="nepimg" src="Planet\Neptune.webp">
      <p class="nepdet">Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is more than 30 times as far from the Sun as<br> 
                        Earth. Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed<br>
                        its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.<br><br>

                        Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The<br> 
                        warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.<br></p>

   <h1 class="nepname">Discovery and Namesake</h1>
    <p class="nepname1">Galileo recorded Neptune as a fixed star during observations with his small telescope in 1612 and 1613. More<br> 
                        than 200 years later, the ice giant became the first planet located through mathematical predictions rather<br> 
                        than through regular observations of the sky. Because Uranus didn't travel exactly as astronomers expected<br> 
                        it to, French mathematician Urbain Joseph Le Verrier proposed the position and mass of a then-unknown planet<br> 
                        that could cause the observed changes to Uranus' orbit. Le Verrier sent his predictions to Johann Gottfried<br> 
                        Galle at the Berlin Observatory, who found Neptune on his first night of searching in 1846. Seventeen days<br> 
                        later, Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered as well.<br></p>
 
  <h1 class="neppl">Potential for Life</h1>
      <p class="neppl1">Neptune's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that<br> 
                        characterize this planet are most likely too extreme, and volatile for organisms to adapt to.<br></p>

  <h1 class="nepsd">Size and Distance</h1>
      <p class="nepsd1">With an equatorial diameter of 30,775 miles (49,528 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth.<br> 
                        If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.<br> 

                        From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away <br>
                        from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this<br> 
                        distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.<br></p>

   <h1 class="nepor">Orbit and Rotation</h1>
      <p class="nepor1">One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes<br> 
                        a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).<br><br>

                        Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto's highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit <br>
                        brings it inside Neptune's orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This switch, in which Pluto is closer <br>
                        to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though <br> 
                        because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close <br>
                        approaches of the two bodies.<br><br>
                        
                        Neptune’s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is <br>
                        similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do on <br>
                        Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years.<br></p>

  <h1 class="nepmn">Moons</h1>
      <p class="nepmn1">Neptune has 16 known moons. Neptune's largest moon Triton was discovered on Oct. 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just<br> 
                        17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea<br> 
                        its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.<br><br>

                        Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet's <br>
                        rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune <br>
                        captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235<br> 
                        degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material<br> 
                        upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton's thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected <br>
                        from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.<br></p>

   <h1 class="nepring">Rings</h1>
    <p class="nepring1">Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the planet<br> 
                        and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings are thought to <br>
                        be relatively young and short-lived.<br></p>

   <img class="nepringimg" src="Planet\Neptunering.jpg">

  <p class="nepringdet">Neptune's ring system also has peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Liberté (Liberty)<br> 
                        Egalité (Equality), Fraternité (Fraternity), and Courage are in the outermost ring, Adams. The arcs are strange<br> 
                        because the laws of motion would predict that they would spread out evenly rather than stay clumped together.<br> 
                        Scientists now think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the <br>
                        ring, stabilizes these arcs.<br></p>


  <h1 class="nepfm">Formation</h1>
      <p class="nepfm1">Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled<br>
                        swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer<br> 
                        to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago.<br></p>

  <h1 class="nepst">Structure</h1>
      <p class="nepst1">Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the<br> 
                        planet's mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia – above a small<br> 
                        rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.<br><br>

                        Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds. It does not boil away<br> 
                        because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.<br></p>

   <h1 class="nepsf">Surface</h1>
      <p class="nepsf1">Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends<br> 
                        to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the<br> 
                        same mass as Earth.<br></p>

  <h1 class="nepat">Atmosphere</h1>
      <p class="nepat1">Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune's<br> 
                        neighbor Uranus has a similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue, giving these ice<br> 
                        giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune, coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as<br> 
                        a much deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images, to better reveal clouds and other<br> 
                        distinctive features on the planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2 had captured<br> 
                        in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images, showing the planets look much<br> 
                        more alike than many thought.<br><br>

                        Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's <br>
                        winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than Earth's. These winds whip clouds of <br> 
                        frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth's<br> 
                        most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).<br><br>
                        
                        In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the "Great Dark Spot" was large enough to<br> 
                        contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on<br> 
                        different parts of the planet.<br></p>


   <h1 class="nepmg">Magnetosphere</h1>
      <p class="nepmg1">The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis.<br> 
                        Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere <br>
                        undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment. The magnetic field of Neptune is<br> 
                        about 27 times more powerful than that of Earth.<br></p>
